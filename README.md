Java Assignment Topic 3. Search Engine.

The Java Assignment comprises of a search engine application. The goal of this is to allow users to search for specific terms within selected text files.

The Main.java is responsible for running the application.

The class SearchEngine.java represents the main GUI window, containing text fields for entering search terms, buttons for initiating searches and selecting files, and an area for displaying search results.

The FileSearcher.java class encapsulates the functionality for searching terms within text files. If matches are found, they're appended to the search results. The results are then displayed in the GUI.

The class FileSelector.java provides functionality for selecting multiple text files using a file chooser dialog. Allowing users to browse and select files.

Some advanced features in our Search Engine: 

In addition to basic keyword searches, some advanced techniques such as wildcard searches have been added to the search engine. The integration of wildcard functionality enables users to broaden their search scope, searches such as 'walk', would match 'walked', 'walking', 'walk', ect. Allowing users to efficiently navigate through the files and extract relevant information.

Users are given the flexibility to select their desired search space, allowing for tailored and efficient searches. Users can choose the files they wish to search, enabling them to narrow down their search by using the search engine to do the task for them.

If given additional time to refine our search engine, we would prioritize the implementation of a ranking system, enabling the algorithm to prioritize search results based on relevance. Additionally, integrating a spell correction mechanism would improve accuracy by automatically identifying spelling errors in user queries.
